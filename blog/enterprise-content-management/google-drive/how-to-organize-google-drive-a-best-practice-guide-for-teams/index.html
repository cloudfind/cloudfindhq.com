      <h2>How to Organize Google Drive – A Best Practice Guide for Teams</h2>
      <p><em>How to organize Google Drive </em>– is a question that many people find themselves asking after using Google Drive
        for a couple of months. This is especially true for teams of people trying to work as efficiently as possible using
        Google Docs, Google Sheets and other documents stored in the cloud.</p>
      <p>Before diving into how to organize Google Drive folders and files, it’s worth exploring the differences between the
        two Google Drive sections called <strong>My Drive </strong>and <strong>Shared with me, </strong>as they can cause
        quite a bit of confusion.</p>
      <h2><strong>My Drive vs. Shared with me  </strong></h2>
      <p>Google Drive has two main locations where it stores files:</p>
      <p><strong>• My Drive </strong>is where you have your own personal stash of documents and folders. By default, any files
        that you create or upload get stored under <strong>My Drive. </strong>You can also choose to share folders and files
        from within this interface, but we’ll cover the behaviour of Google Drive <strong>sharing </strong>features later.</p>
      <p><strong>• Shared with me</strong> <strong> </strong>is the place where (you’ve guessed it!) all of the shared folders
        and documents are stored in. Note that only those Google Drive folders and files that other people have <em>explicitly</em>        shared with you are stored under the <strong>Shared with me </strong>section. Shared with me is what people typically
        refer to as their Google Shared Drive. It’s the most direct equivalent to a traditional network shared drive.</p>
      <p>One notable thing about <strong>Shared with me</strong> is that you can right-click on any Google Drive folder or file
        and get the option to <strong>Add to My Drive. </strong>Adding a file or a folder to <strong>My Drive</strong> using
        this mechanism will show that file or folder inside <strong>My Drive. </strong>Once in My Drive, you can locate it
        anywhere you want (to a sub-folder, for example) <em>without it affecting the sharing location in other people’s My Drives</em>.
        My Drive is just that: it’s <em>your</em> drive. Someone else’s may not have the same structure (even if it contains
        the same files).</p>
      <p>Now let’s explore the strategies and techniques for how to organize Google Drive.</p>
      <h2><strong>How to Organize Google Drive – the strategic way</strong></h2>
      <h3>1. Define your shared top-level team folders.</h3>
      <h4><em>Tidy room, tidy mind.</em></h4>
      <table border="2" width="659" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>How it can help:</strong></td>
            <td><strong>Dangers of not doing it:</strong></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>It will keep your Google Drive view “clean” and easy to browse through</td>
            <td>Things can quickly descend into folder chaos, making it difficult for people to find what they’re looking for</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>It will give your colleagues a logical and consistent Google Drive folder structure for storing and finding files
              more easily</td>
            <td>It’s harder and more time-consuming for people to store documents in the correct Google Drive folder</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Bottom line:<br>
      It saves you time</strong></td>
            <td><strong>Bottom line:<br>
      Leads to confusion and inefficiencies</strong></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>It is advisable that you organize your top level Google Drive folders by departments. This will help prevent clutter,
        whilst making sure team members only see the documents related to their work.</p>
      <p>To achieve this, make sure your top-level folders are shared only with the relevant people. Why would Marketing need
        access to the entire Procurement folder? If they need a specific file like a procurement template, either share it
        with them individually or put it in a sub-folder called “Procurement files for Marketing” that’s shared with both
        departments.
      </p>
      <p>Bear in mind that any time you share Google Drive folders or files with someone, they automatically get put in that
        person’s <strong>Shared with me</strong> section. This means that the shared folders/files will automatically get
        indexed by Google Drive, with the potential to clutter every single search that that user does in Google Drive itself.</p>
      <p>I can’t even count just how many times I did a Google Drive search and ended up with tens and hundreds of results to
        sift through, simply because of stuff that people shared with me.</p>
      <p>To summarize, sharing can get cumbersome and lead to inefficiencies. <strong>Share wisely.</strong></p>
      <h3>2. Establish a descriptive naming convention.</h3>
      <h4><em>Call a spade a spade.</em></h4>
      <table border="2" width="659" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>How it can help:</strong></td>
            <td><strong>Dangers of not doing it:</strong></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Descriptive file names make it easy to identify what you’re looking for without having to open the file</td>
            <td>Makes it harder for people to find what they’re looking for</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Makes Google Drive search more precise – since file names are priotized over the keywords inside the file itself</td>
            <td>More often than not you’ll have to open several different files to find the one you’re actually looking for</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Bottom line:<br>
      It saves you time</strong></td>
            <td><strong>Bottom line:<br>
      Leads to confusion and inefficiencies</strong></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>The last thing you want is to clog up your whole Google Drive account with thousands of files that don’t have useful
        names or even worse, have meaningless numbers or codes assigned as their names. How will you and your colleagues
        find anything?</p>
      <p>Having a file naming convention is mission critical. And the first step to a having a successful file naming convention
        for Google Drive is to decide on what type of information is most important for your business, so you can reflect
        it in the file name.</p>
      <p>Things you could include in the name of a file are:</p>
      <p><strong>What type of document is it</strong> — contract, invoice, proposal etc.<br>
        <strong>Who or what it relates to</strong> — customer name, project name, office name etc.<br>
        <strong>What the status of the file is</strong> — approved, not approved, archived etc.<br>
        <strong>The official date of the file  </strong>— other than the creation date or the last modified date.</p>
      <p>This will help everyone find files quicker when searching across their Google Drive account.</p>
      <p>The main challenge when it comes to having a good file naming convention for Google Drive is consistency. Your pitch-perfect
        naming convention doesn’t stand a chance if people aren’t following it and naming files the right way.</p>
      <p>To tackle this, make sure everyone knows and understands why the naming rules you have in place are important. Write
        the rules on a poster and stick them on a wall (keep it short). Send out a company memo (or three). As with many
        things in life, here too consistency is key.</p>
      <h3>3. Advise people to keep their own files in private folders and to share purposefully.</h3>
      <h4><em>Less is more.</em></h4>
      <table border="2" width="659" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>How it can help:</strong></td>
            <td><strong>Dangers of not doing it:</strong></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Avoid clutter</td>
            <td>Cluttering will form and prevent ease of access to the right files</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Makes Google Drive search more precise (searching over a reduced dataset)</td>
            <td>Google Drive search will become less efficient, returning more irrelevant results</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Bottom line:<br>
      It saves you time</strong></td>
            <td><strong>Bottom line:<br>
      Leads to confusion and inefficiencies</strong></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>As we saw in the first section of this article (<strong>My Drive vs Shared with me</strong>), one thing about Google
        Drive sharing is that a user doesn’t have a way of accepting or rejecting any of the incoming shared documents of
        folders. So, as people share more and more files and folders with you, your <strong>Shared with me</strong> bucket
        in Google Drive gets filled (unless you manually remove the irrelevant files and folders).</p>
      <p>To add to this, not every single file or folder that people share are always useful. Often times it’s a question of
        <em>“I better make sure he/she has access, just in case!” – </em>which leads to a lot of unnecessary sharing.</p>
      <p>Left unchecked, <strong>Shared with me</strong> can quickly render Google Drive search extremely inefficient. This
        happens because Google indexes <strong>everything</strong> in your Google Drive account, so any searches you do will
        bring up files and folders from both <b>My Drive </b>and <strong>Shared with me </strong>(which can be a good thing
        in some cases).</p>
      <p>Thus, the question becomes <em>how to organize Google Drive in such a way that prevents the above from happening?</em></p>
      <p>Two options are:</p>
      <p>1. For important shared documents and folders, make sure to<strong> “Add to My Drive”. </strong>This will add the file
        or folder to your <strong>My Drive</strong> section, where you’ll be able to move it and organize it into any of
        your existing private folders (without making it sync its new location for other people who also have the item shared
        with them).</p>
      <p><strong>However, some updates will still be synced:</strong> If you change the name of the Google Drive folder or file,
        or their contents, the updates will propagate to other people who have the item shared with them.</p>
      <p>2. For irrelevant or out of date documents to which you don’t need access anymore, simply right-click on them and select
        <strong>Remove</strong>.</p>
      <h2>In conclusion</h2>
      <p><em>Clutter is simply delayed decisions.</em></p>
      <p>Technology was supposed to make life easier for us in the 21st century. And it did, to some degree. We’re now working
        with thousands of documents stored in the cloud and also syncing them to our gazillion shiny devices–which is great!
        But the task of organizing everything and making sure information is easily accessible, still falls on human shoulders.</p>
      <p>As the volumes of information increase, many more teams and departments start asking questions about <em>how to organize Google Drive</em>.
        The three strategies described above are not exhaustive, yet they should help you start off with a strong, well-organized
        Google Drive structure. This, in turn, will help your team members work more efficiently, enabling them to find the
        files that they’re looking for, faster.</p>
      <h2>Next level…</h2>
      <p>Using the Google Drive description field to add document metadata and/or file tags would be the next step up in terms
        of organizing documents in a robust and flexible way.</p>
      <h2>Find files faster and be more efficient.</h2>
